# üìä Mobile App Review Analysis with BigQuery & Vertex AI

## Introduction
Understanding user feedback is critical for improving mobile applications and enhancing customer satisfaction. This project leverages BigQuery, Vertex AI, and data visualization to explore and analyze mobile app reviews.

The workflow includes:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, normalizing app versions, and imputing ratings using AI-generated estimates.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the most reviewed apps, distribution of ratings, country-wise averages, and identifying top and bottom performers.  
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Using Gemini models to summarize user sentiment, extract key themes, and recommend actionable improvements.  
- **Embedding & Chatbot**: Creating vector representations of reviews to power semantic search, enabling natural language queries. This allows product managers to ask questions like *‚ÄúWhich apps have too many ads?‚Äù* and receive context-driven insights.  

By combining traditional analytics with generative AI, this notebook provides a powerful toolkit for product teams, data analysts, and app developers to better understand user sentiment, identify pain points, and drive product enhancements.
